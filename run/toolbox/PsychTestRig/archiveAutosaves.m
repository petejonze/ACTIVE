% @VerHistory:      0.1.n   First iteration. Used for first experiment
%                           (exp1ver8)
%                   0.2.1   Second iteration. Used for second experiment
%                        	(Summer Scientists). Made general bug
%                        	corrections and syntactic improvements.
%                        	Incorporated new utilities (calibration, signal
%                        	processing). Did some housekeeping. Improved
%                        	documentation. Changed the expected directory
%                        	structure for experiments. Everything still
%                        	very much in its infancy!
%                   0.2.2   Few tweaks, including compatability issues with
%                           the mac. Plus improved level calibration
%                   0.3     Properly formatted Contents.m, so shows up on
%                           'Ver'. Lots of little tweaks. Had to rename
%                           master dir as 'PsychTestRig' to get it all
%                           working properly. General restructuring.

%                           Lots. Improved initialisation (version check,
%                           random seeding). Improved calibration. Added
%                           lots of misc utilities.
